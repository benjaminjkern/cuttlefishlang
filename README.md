![cuttlefish](etc/cuttlefish.png "Cuttlefish!")

Cuttlefish is a strong, statically typed language designed to empower its users to write elegant, safe, and functional code for concurrent systems.

It structurally draws from many aspects of Haskell, Elixir, and Python, and it strives to allow its users to have immense power over the style of their code, as long as it is falls into what is considered clean, cohesive, "Cuttly" code.

## Introduction

There are three types of Routines that Cuttlefish can handle, all equipped with immersive pattern matching and precise functional capabilities.

| Routine        | Functions `fn:` | Processes `prc:`        | Servers `srv:`                    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Description    |                 |                         |                                   |
| Can call       | Functions       | Functions and Processes | Functions, Processes, and Servers |
| Internal state |                 |                         |                                   |
